# Jazz-App
This is a project which is property of Two members. The project is actually the combination of two mobile apps called **Jazz Cash** and **Jazz World** with some aditional features added. However, it's just a desktop based aapplication and directly accessible on the file systsem as no database has been yet connected to the system. 

>It should be kept in mind, that this is just a university project and we have just cloned this project for our term system. No rights have been bought from **Jazz**, So the original Rights beong to them only.

## Description
So basically this project again has the two actors, one is the user which will have to first get registered into the system to be able to use the system and the other is admin of the system which are given all the rights to use the system accroding to the needs. The user have to get a unique number to get registered otherwise, the user wont be allowed to get registered. Similarly the user will be updated with the ba;ance once he\she gets active into the syetem. Depending on the need, the system has all the features that the jazz cash and jazz world has.

### Note
> Again reminding that no API has been used to connect it to the official Jazz Apps.
